    <h2> History of Nur-Sultan </h2>
        <p> 
            <li>
            After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the consequent independence of Kazakhstan, the city's original name was restored in the modified form Akmola.
            <li>
            On 6 July 1994, the Supreme Council of Kazakhstan adopted the decree "On the transfer of the capital of Kazakhstan".
            <li>
            After the capital of Kazakhstan was moved to Akmola on 10 December 1997, the city was consequently renamed Astana in 1998.
            <li>
            On 10 June 1998, Astana was presented as the capital internationally.
            <li>
            Due to several determined advantages, Astana was chosen as the capital: large urban areas, favorable geographical position, 
            <br>
            proximity to the major economic centers of the region, considerable demographic capacity, good transportation facilities, and a relatively favorable climate.
            <li>
            On 16 July 1999, Astana was awarded the medal and title of the City of Peace by UNESCO.
            <li>
            On 19 March 2019, president Nursultan Nazarbayev resigned, and on 23 March the city was renamed Nur-Sultan.
            <li>
            While it is officially called Nur-Sultan, many residents still refer to it as Astana
